# spacex-and-mars 🚀

Check out this SpaceX missions and Mars weather website at [SpaceX and Mars](https://www.spacexandmars.com)! 🚀🚀🚀

## Introduction
The website displays information about SpaceX's next upcoming, future and past mission at SpaceX Mission page, the weather on Mars at Mars page and general information at About page. Note that the site is created purely for coding/learning web development practices and personal interest about going to Mars, and doesn't have any relations with either SpaceX or NASA.

## Deploy
A [NASA API Key](https://api.nasa.gov/) is required. 
* Create a `.env` file in the same directory as `src` folder
* Save the key in `.env` 

### For production (local)
1. Clone the repo, and `cd` into
2. `npm install` to install node_modules
3 `npm run build` to build the application (it generates a build folder), then
4 `serve -s build` to serve the application. It should be served at port 5000 by default
For hosting on a server, the root directory is \<application path\>/build/.

### For development
Step 1, 2 then run `npm start`, the application should be served on localhost port 3000 by default.

## Development
### APIs
* [SpaceX API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API)
* [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/)

### Languages
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

### Libraries/Frameworks
* ReactJS
* Bootstrap
* Semantic UI

## What's next👇
* Code refactoring
* Improve UI for mobile version
* Adding SpaceX rocket and spaceship pages

I'm open for any feedbacks or concerns!😃 Thanks you🙏 And Go SpaceX🚀🚀
